# Next Box Office Hit Analysis

**Author**: [Jamald O. Aquino]

## Overview

This project analyzes the top fifty most lucrative films in the past five years. In order for Microsoft to enter the film industry successfully, analysis of several film databases were done in search for current and ongoing trends of the most successful films. Analysis shows that popular genres like 'Horror', 'Thriller', and 'Drama' do most successful at the box office, with a recommended release date in the month of July or October. Production budgets range between 3.5 million US dollars and 12 million dollars.

## Business Problem

Microsoft is looking to create its own original video content, and have decided to enter the film industry. Microsoft does not know anything about creating movies. Knowing the genre, how much of a budget to allocate, and what time of the year to release a film could help Microsoft be equally successful as the current film industry giants.

## Data

The data used was taken from two different websites: The Numbers and TheMovieDB. Both databases are stored in 'csv' format. The Numbers database contains the production budgets, domestic gross, and worldwide gross of several films, while TheMovieDB database contains the films' genres, and both contain the release dates of the films.

## Results

According to the data, a successful box office hit would have a production budget anywhere between 3.5 million dollars and 12 million dollars with the mean production budget being around 12 million dollars and the median being 5 million dollars.

According to the data, the most lucrative genres that generate the highest return of investment are 'Horror', 'Thriller,' and 'Drama.'

## Conclusions

This analysis leads to three recommendations for improving operations of the Austin Animal Center:

- **Set a production budget of between 3.5 million dollars and 12 million dollars,** in favor of a higher budget on the range.
- **Select the genre of the movie to be among 'Horror,' 'Thriller,' or 'Drama.'** Some films fit more than one genre, giving more creative freedom.
- **Release the film during the months of July, October, or March,** with July being the most advantageous month of the three.
### Next Steps

- **Consider what movie rating(G, PG, PG-13, R, or NC-17) is best for the film** A lower movie rating could incentivize more people to see the film.
- **Consider releasing films on streaming services.** more and more major studios are releasing their films on their respective streaming services.
